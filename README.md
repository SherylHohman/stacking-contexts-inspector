# Stacking Contexts Inspector
The Stacking Contexts Inspector is a [devtools extension for Google Chrome](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/css-stacking-context-insp/apjeljpachdcjkgnamgppgfkmddadcki) that allows you to analyse the stacking contexts available on a webpage. Here you will find all the informations you need to get up and running with using this tool. I'm also working toward making this extension open source, but I still need to cleanup the code and port it to preact (I've used custom techniques to handle all the components, so it would be very difficult to understand right now).

This extension will add a new panel to the devtools, and a new sidebar on the elements panel.

### Known bugs and things to keep in mind
* This extension work by analysing the page at a specific point in time (when you open the panel or the sidebar). It won't automatically react to changes in the page. However, you can use the reload button on the top of the stacking context panel to re-analyse the page at any time.
* Currently, when you install this extension you won't be able to inspect contexts within pages that were already open before the installation. You have to reload them to see their stacking contexts.

If you find any other issue or have some feature request, feel free to use the [Issues section](https://github.com/andreadev-it/stacking-contexts-inspector/issues) here on github to share them.

## The Stacking Contexts panel
This panel will show you a tree-like representation of all the stacking contexts available on the page.

When hovering over a context, the DOM element will be highlighted in the page. If you don't see any highlight, it might be because the element is not visible, or it's outside of the viewport. For the second option, you can right-click on the context and select the "Scroll into view" button in the context menu.

If you click on a context, it will be selected and some in-depth information will be shown on the sidepane.

### The panel sidepane
The sidepane shows informations related to the stacking context that is currently selected in the tree view. It is divided into two sections: "Info about the context" and "Children z-index order".

In the first section, you can see why this DOM element is creating a new stacking context. There might be multiple reasons for this, and all of them will be shown as an unordered list in this section.

In the second section, you can find a list of all the stacking contexts that are children of the selected context. They'll be ordered from the one which is visible on top (higher z-index) to the one that will show behind everything else (lower z-index). It will also show all the elements that have no z-index applied, but have a position of "relative" or "absolute", since this values will slightly alter the order the elements are printed (might be changed in the future). If you right click on one of these stacking contexts, you will have the same options for the contexts shown in the tree view: you can inspect the related DOM element or scroll the viewport to show it.

## The Elements panel Stacking Contexts sidebar
When you install this extension, a new sidebar will be added to the right of the elements panel, where you can also find the "Styles", "Computed", "Layout" and other sidebars. It might not be immediatly visible, in that case you can make the sidebar larger to show all options, or click on the "Â»" button in the top-right to show all the hidden sidebars names.

The sidebar is divided into multiple sections:

### Node details
This section will give you an immediate feedback on whether or not the z-index property is working on the DOM element. If the element selected has no z-index and doesn't create a stacking context, a coherent message will appear.

### Context details
This section will show an unordered list that explains why the current element is creating a new stacking context. If you don't want it to be creating a context, you can use these informations to know where to tweak your CSS.

### Parent context
This is very self-explanatory: it just shows which element is the parent stacking context. It will show you the element which is the closest ancestor to the currently selected element, and which also creates a stacking context.

### Siblings z-index order
Similarly to the "children z-index order" in the Stacking Context panel, it will show a list of stacking contexts along with their z-indexes, in order from the one that shows on top to the one that shows behind everything (from highest to lowest z-index).
The stacking contexts shown in this list are the ones that directly compare to the current element on their z-index values, since they're all children of the same stacking context. The currently selected context will also appear on this list.
